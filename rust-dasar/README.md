# 🦀 Rust Basics - Learning Rust from Scratch

Welcome to **Rust Basics!** 🚀 This repository is my first step into learning the Rust programming language. I'll be exploring Rust’s unique features, best practices, and writing simple programs along the way.

## 📌 About This Project

This repository serves as a collection of my Rust exercises, experiments, and projects as I get familiar with Rust’s syntax and concepts. It’s a hands-on learning journey to build a strong foundation in Rust development.

## 🔥 What I'm Learning

- 🦀 Rust Syntax and Basics
- ⚡ Memory Safety and Ownership
- 🏗 Structs, Enums, and Traits
- 📦 Crates and Modules
- 🔄 Error Handling
- 🌐 Concurrency with Rust
- 💡 Writing Efficient and Safe Code

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you want to run the Rust code in this repository, make sure you have Rust installed:

1️⃣ **Install Rust using rustup:**

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2️⃣ **Clone this repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/r1anpratama/practice_rust.git
cd practice_rust
```

3️⃣ **Run a Rust program:**

```sh
cargo run
```

**Distribution file:**

```sh
cargo build --release
```

**Unit test:**

```sh
cargo test function_name -- --exact
```

## 🌱 Future Plans

- If we use variable let = imutable
- you can use let mut = mutable
